### License
This program comes with a GPL-3.0 license. Use this program however you'd like with no warranty.

Basic usage guide: 
1. Clone this repository
2. Add all the necessary information in the info.example.py file 
3. Rename it to info.py
4. Install all needed dependencies. 
5. Run the main file locally or on a VPS

Every 30 seconds, it should print in the output if any new tweets have been by posted by the target account. The bot will reply with the song and lyric name to the target account on new tweets, also changing its profile image to the album cover of the song.

For any issues, please submit a GitHub issue and I will help you out.

### Note
Occasionaly, it will reply with an incorrect song title if the lyric is a close match. This is a result of Genius's end, apologies for the confusion.

This isn't the official source code when used running. Instead, this is a more organized version for public usage. Check the source code out on [Replit](https://replit.com/@KrishRao1/Frank-Ocean-Bot-Bot?v=1).

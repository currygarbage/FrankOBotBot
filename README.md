### License
This program comes with a GPL-3.0 license. Use this program however you'd like with no warranty.

To use this, add all the necessary information in the info.example.py file. Rename it to info.py, and install all needed dependencies. Afterwards, run the main file locally or on any VPS of your choice.

### Note
Occasionaly, it will reply with an incorrect song title if the lyric is a close match. This is a result of Genius's end, apologies for the confusion.

Also, this isn't the official source code when used running. Check the source code out on [Replit](https://replit.com/@KrishRao1/Frank-Ocean-Bot-Bot?v=1).

### Thanks

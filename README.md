This is the main source code, check it out on my [Replit](https://replit.com/@KrishRao1/Frank-Ocean-Bot-Bot?v=1).

### License
This program comes with a GPL-3.0 license. Use this program however you'd like with no warranty.

As mentioned, this is the main source code that is officially used while running. We recommend tweaking the code to fit your own needs, as this script was designed with Frank Ocean lyrics in mind.

### Note
Occasionaly, it will reply with an incorrect song title if the lyric is a close match. This is a result of Genius's end, apologies for the confusion.

### Thanks
Thanks to [@mitskibotbot](https://twitter.com/mitskibotbot) for this Twitter bot idea.
